Description:
•This is a simple console-based Java game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.
•The player gets limited attempts (7 tries) to find the correct number.
•After each guess, the program gives feedback:
•"Too high" if the guess is larger than the number.
•"Too low" if the guess is smaller than the number.
•"Correct" if the guess is right.
•The game also has a score system. If you guess the number quickly, you earn a higher score.
•After one round, the player can choose to play again or end the game.
•At the end, the program shows the final score.
